1. For this assignment, read about the concept of realease early, release often
and write at least one reason for and one reason against this practice in the
submission box.

     For:
	Because you are getting feedback from your users more frequently you are
able to make sure the new features you are implementing fully conform to your 
audience's needs.
	The user becomes a much bigger part in development potentially making 
the product more relevant.


     Against:
	Some argue that by releasing an unfinished product you run the risk of
alienating potential users by providing them a poor experience.
