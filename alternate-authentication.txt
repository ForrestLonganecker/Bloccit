  I looked into OpenID, in this assignment we used 'passport-local' which uses local authentication. There are technologies
set up to make it easier for someone to log into a website by limiting the number of logins they must use overall. OpenID 
is a decentralized authentication strategy that allows people to log into your website with the login credentials they have used 
in a different site. 

  For instance, when you set up a CodeWars account, you have the option of signing in via multiple options, a couple being:
GitHub, and Google.

  I like this method because it can make things a lot more streamlined for the user experience, I personally love having the option to not set 
up an entirely new login for every site I use. This strategy actually sends data off to the authentication provider "GitHub/Google" they
confirm whether it is correct or not and let your website know.
